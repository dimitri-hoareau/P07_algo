# P07_ALGO
Python resolution to the backpack problem with algorythm

## About The Project

* The objectif is to find the best solution to invest in multiple stocks with a maximum budget
* The first solution is a bruteforce algorythm
* The second solution is dynamic programming

### Tested With
Python 3.8.5

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Getting Started

To start this project, you need to :
- clone the repo from this page.
- no needs of virtual environment nor requierements
- launch the app with python, for the bruteforce :
 ```
python3 bruteforce.py
```
In this case, the used data are a fake array of actions with faje values and benefit. If you want to test with the correct data, comment the line 6 and uncomment the line 7 or 8 in bruteforce.py. But it will crash the app. 

For the dynamic programming algorythm : 

 ```
python3 optimized.py
```
In this case, the used data come from the file dataset1_Python+P7.csv. If you want to use the data from datasetZ_Python+P7.csv, comment the line 61 and uncomment the line 62 in optimized.py.
